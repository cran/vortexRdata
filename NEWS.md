# vortexRdata 1.0.5
* Update data format to reflect new output format of irr (0.84.1)

# vortexRdata 1.0.4
* Update the code examples in the docs to use raw data provided by
  `vortexRdata` rather than `vortexR`, where it originally was stored.
  Now the usage examples in the docs are correct and inline with the README.

# vortexRdata 1.0.3
* This version was accepted on CRAN and is imported by `vortexR`.

# vortexRdata pre-1.0.3
Versions 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 were submitted to CRAN and rejected with reviewer
requests to fine-tune some formatting of DESCRIPTION and code docs.

The history of these changes is preserved in earlier revisions of cran-comments.md
on GitHub, but removed in the current released version 1.0.3.
